    "Imagine your loan application has just been rejected by your bank. You ask them why, and they respond that the neighborhood you live in scored poorly for likelihood to pay the loan back. For some reason this bank has the algorithm they use online. You look into it a bit more, and you realize that though the bank does not use race as a feature, those who live in predominantly African American neighborhoods are almost three times as likely to be denied a loan. Disparate impact refers to \"when policies, practices, rules or other systems that appear to be neutral result in a disproportionate impact on a protected group\". No one in the bank sat down and say \"hey, I'm going to create a fairly racist predictor!\". But, the rules that the bank goes by dispraportionately impact African Americans. Situations like these are all too common in the United States, and they must be addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On October 28, 2019, a video of around ten police officers tackling and pulling guns on a black teen for evading the \\$2.75 subway fare in New York City went viral. Communities were enraged to see this fierceley violent attack on a teen of color over such a small fare. A few months before, the MTA calculated that they were losing millions annually due to those who evade paying the transit fare. The MTA decided to deploy 500 new officers to watch for turnstile hoppers, in hopes of losing less money. While in theory this plan makes sense, we can't help but wonder. What kind of disparate impact against communities of color is happening? What about against lower income communities?\n"
